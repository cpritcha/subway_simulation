\section{Conclusions}

Subway systems help transport people all over the world. This paper created a
simple model of the Scarborough line in Toronto. By varying the number of trains
and the presence of delays the model showed a substantial increase in passengers
served going from four trains to eight trains under average load. 

\subsection{Limitations}

The model used in this paper is limited and could be improved in many ways. Passengers
destinations in this model are generated independent of the station they are generated
from. This means that passengers do not always take the shortest route to get where
they want to go. Stations in this model can also only hold one train. Since many train
stations allow trains to pass a docked train it would be helpful to incorporate that
into the model. Variation in passenger arrival numbers is also needed to better model
rush hour where passenger arrival is very high one direction and low the other (but 
that would require data we do not have access to).
