    "## Motivation\n",
    "* The world's largest cities are dependent on subway networks\n",
    "* Service distruptions interfere with personal lives, commercial and industrial productivity, and loss of revenue for the service operators\n",
    "* Being able to model service disruptions is key when trying to develop solutions for disruption scenarios\n",
    "* Modeling during the design process and before construction can also yield more efficient systems with lower operating costs, lower delays due to disruptions, and increased daily passenger capacity\n",

    "## Subway System Components\n",
    "* Subway systems consist of many interdependent components working together\n",
    "    * Trains\n",
    "    * Stations\n",
    "    * Track sections\n",
    "    * Passengers\n",
    "* Each of these are easily represented by atomic models in the DEVS framework\n",
    "    * The challenge in modeling these components are in managing the communications and defining the behavior\n",
    "* For behavior and other model specific quantities, available Toronto Transit Commision data is used as a reference because it is openly available online\n",
    "    * This includes train capacity, subway station layouts, times between stations, and passenger arrivals and departures per station per business day\n",
    "* Unknown quantities include passenger board and depart times, specific delay times associated with a particular issue (breakdown, station closure, etc.)\n",

    "## Typical Modeling Goals\n",
    "* Optimized quantities when considering subway system design generally inlude operating costs and passenger capacity\n",
    "    * More trains can carry more passengers, but can also increase train congestion on the network, slowing down service overall\n",
    "    * More trains can also be more expensive to operate, but if enough passengers are riding, the additional revenues may yield more profit\n",
    "    * Per train capacity can be increased, for example by adding an additional car, but this also increases operating costs and build costs due to the increased propulsion power required\n",
    "* Simulations generally need to be designed to avoid deadlock\n",
    "    * Deadlock occurs when no trains are able to move on the entire network\n",
    "        * Consider an even where one train is broken down in each direction near each other\n",
    "        * Over time, all trains will eventually be stuck behind the broken down trains and a deadlock condition occurs\n",
    "    * Modeling subway networks can aid in the proper placement of rail switches that allow trains to bypass one another, hopefully preventing a deadlock condition\n"

    "## Scheduler Logic\n",
    "* The Scheduler is synonymous with the Coordinator atomic model\n",
    "    * Is is essentially the brains of the system\n",
    "* Train positions are bookkept internally to avoid further needs for communication through ports\n",
    "    * Anytime actual information is needed, the ports are used, but the Train instances do not necessarily need to know where they are\n",
    "        * The trains have an assumed order of states and it is the Scheduler's responsibility to ensure the trains only move when allowed and are located in the correct position\n",
    "* If the trains needed to communicate directly with the stations, then every train would need to be coupled with every station\n",
    "    * Instead the coupler routes messages appropriately based on its internal bookkeeping\n",
    "* This means interactions between components can be handled at the Scheduler level"
